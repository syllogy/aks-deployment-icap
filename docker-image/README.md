# Docker Image for Deployment

This image has been created so we can isolate deployments and stop edge case issues between each users system.

You can pull the image from our private Dockerhub or build the image with the Dockerfile.

## Building and using the image

To build the image run the command below:

```bash
docker build -t aks-deployment .
```

After it has finished building, you can then use the below command to get exec access and then start using the container:

```bash
docker run -it aks-deployment:latest /bin/bash
```
